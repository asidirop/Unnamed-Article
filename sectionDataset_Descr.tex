\section{Dataset Description}\label{dataset-description}

For the purposes of this study, we collected data from Microsoft
Academic Search (MAS)\footnote{We appreciate the offer of Microsoft to
  gratis provide their database API. The API that was used in this work
  has been discontinued by Microsoft in the summer of 2016.}; in
particular, we extracted full citation data starting from year 1950 up
to 2015 for scientists publishing in the Computer Science area, as
identified by the domain categorization of MAS. All related meta-data
about their publication, citation and collaboration network were also
retrieved. The initial query to MAS was intended to select all authors
in Computer Science with more than 5 publications. Unfortunately, the
publication year is missing for 12\% of the publications in our
datasets. To complete this missing information, we gathered data from
DBLP\footnote{http://dblp.uni-trier.de/} by using the XML search DBLP
API. This way, we recovered about 6\% of the missing information. After
that step, the publications with missing year were ignored as well as
the citations from publications with missing year. In the end, we
collected 104,190 authors with a complete network of 4,805,131
publications and 20,877,029 citations. For illustrative purposes we have
also utilized a small subset of our dataset that contains 700 Computer
Science researchers from Greek Universities.
